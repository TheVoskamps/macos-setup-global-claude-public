name: issue-set-blocked-by
description: Declare that one issue is blocked by another (blocked-by edge). Idempotent.
---

Add a blocked-by relationship: "issue N is blocked by issue B".
This is one side of the blocked-by edge — `/issue-set-blocks` is the
same edge from the blocker's perspective.

See `skills/lib/issue.md` for the shared GraphQL templates, tracker
dispatch, the "One edge, two sides" pattern, and error wording. This
file documents only what is specific to `/issue-set-blocked-by`.

## Invocation

```text
/issue-set-blocked-by <N> <blocker-N>
```

- `<N>` (required): issue number of the **blocked** issue (the one
  that can't proceed until the blocker is done).
- `<blocker-N>` (required): issue number of the **blocker** (the
  prerequisite).

Mnemonic: "set blocked-by of N to B" reads left-to-right.

## Tracker dispatch

Apply the standard `issues:` switch from `skills/lib/issue.md`. Jira
aborts with the shared message.

## Execution (GitHub backend)

1. **Look up node IDs for both issues** using the node-ID lookup
   template from `skills/lib/issue.md`, trimmed to `id` plus
   `blockedBy(first: 50) { nodes { number } }` on the blocked side
   (to detect an existing relationship for the idempotency check).
   If the blocked issue might have more than 50 blockers, the
   idempotency check may miss an existing edge and the mutation will
   then no-op on the server side; the mutation itself is safe to
   retry, so this is acceptable.

2. **Idempotency check.** If `<blocker-N>` is already in the blocked
   issue's `blockedBy.nodes`, no-op: print one line (`Issue #<N> is
   already blocked by #<B>; no change.`) and exit zero.

3. **Create the edge** via the `addBlockedBy` template from
   `skills/lib/issue.md`. Pass:
   - `issueId = <node id of N>` (the **blocked** issue).
   - `blockingIssueId = <node id of B>` (the **blocker**).

4. **Issue not found**: if either node-ID lookup returns
   `repository.issue: null`, emit the "Issue not found" error from
   the catalogue and abort, identifying which issue was missing.

## Output

```text
Marked issue #<N> as blocked by #<B>.
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>
```
