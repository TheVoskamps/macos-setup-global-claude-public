name: issue-set-blocks
description: Declare that one issue blocks another (blocked-by edge from the blocker's side). Sugar for /issue-set-blocked-by with inverted args.
---

Add a blocking relationship: "issue N blocks issue B". This is the
blocker's-side view of the same edge that `/issue-set-blocked-by`
exposes — both verbs call `addBlockedBy`, just with the arguments
swapped.

See `skills/lib/issue.md` for the shared GraphQL templates, tracker
dispatch, the "One edge, two sides" pattern, and error wording. This
file documents only what is specific to `/issue-set-blocks`.

## Invocation

```text
/issue-set-blocks <N> <blocked-N>
```

- `<N>` (required): issue number of the **blocker** (the
  prerequisite).
- `<blocked-N>` (required): issue number of the issue being
  **blocked** by N.

Mnemonic: "set blocks of N to B" — "N blocks B". Same edge as
`set-blocked-by B N`.

## Tracker dispatch

Apply the standard `issues:` switch from `skills/lib/issue.md`. Jira
aborts with the shared message.

## Execution (GitHub backend)

1. **Look up node IDs for both issues** using the node-ID lookup
   template from `skills/lib/issue.md`, trimmed to `id` plus
   `blocking(first: 50) { nodes { number } }` on the blocker side
   (to detect an existing relationship for the idempotency check).

2. **Idempotency check.** If `<blocked-N>` is already in the
   blocker's `blocking.nodes`, no-op: print one line (`Issue #<N>
   already blocks #<B>; no change.`) and exit zero.

3. **Create the edge** via the `addBlockedBy` template from
   `skills/lib/issue.md`. Note the **swapped arguments** vs.
   `/issue-set-blocked-by`:
   - `issueId = <node id of <blocked-N>>` (the **blocked** issue is
     what `addBlockedBy.issueId` names; see the lib's call-site
     mapping).
   - `blockingIssueId = <node id of <N>>` (the **blocker** — i.e.
     the first CLI argument).

4. **Issue not found**: if either node-ID lookup returns
   `repository.issue: null`, emit the "Issue not found" error from
   the catalogue and abort.

## Output

```text
Marked issue #<N> as blocking #<B>.
https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/issues/<N>
```
